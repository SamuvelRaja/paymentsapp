# MERN Stack Application

This project is a MERN stack application that resembles Paytm. It includes a landing page, login, signup, and dashboard functionalities. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the JWT authentication system in a MERN stack app. Libraries like Zod are used for validation on both the frontend and backend. Protected routes are implemented using React Router, providing a better understanding of authentication in a MERN app.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main folders:
- `Frontend`
- `Backend`

## How to Run

### Clone the Project

First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

## Running the Backend

Navigate to the Backend directory:
```bash
cd Backend
```
Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
Copy the contents from .example to .env:

```bash
cp .examplenv .env
```
Create your MongoDB instance and replace the URL in the .env file. Also, add your JWT secret.

Running the Frontend
Navigate to the Frontend/payit directory:

```bash
cd Frontend/payit
```
Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
###Features
-Landing Page: The main entry point of the application.
-Login: Allows users to log in using their credentials.
-Signup: Allows new users to create an account.
-Dashboard: A protected route that only authenticated users can access.

###Libraries Used
-Zod: For validation on both frontend and backend.
-React Router: For implementing protected routes.

###Understanding JWT Authentication
This project demonstrates how to implement JWT authentication in a MERN stack application. JWT tokens are used to protect routes and ensure that only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application.

###Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive example of how to implement JWT authentication in a MERN stack application. By following the instructions above, you can run the application on your local machine and explore the various features implemented.
